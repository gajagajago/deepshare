# /etc/sysconfig/slurm for Cray XT/XE systems
#
# Cray is SuSe-based, which means that ulimits from /etc/security/limits.conf
# will get picked up any time slurm is restarted e.g. via pdsh/ssh. Since slurm
# respects configured limits, this can mean that for instance batch jobs get
# killed as a result of configuring CPU time limits. Set sane start limits here.
#
# Values were taken from pam-1.1.2 Debian package
ulimit -t unlimited	# max amount of CPU time in seconds
ulimit -d unlimited	# max size of a process's data segment in KB
ulimit -l 64		# max memory size (KB) that may be locked into memory
ulimit -m unlimited	# max RSS size in KB
ulimit -u unlimited	# max number of processes
ulimit -f unlimited	# max size of files written by process and children
ulimit -x unlimited	# max number of file locks
ulimit -i 16382		# max number of pending signals
ulimit -q 819200	# max number of bytes in POSIX message queues
ulimit -Sc 0		# max size of core files (soft limit)
ulimit -Hc unlimited	# max size of core files (hard limit)
ulimit -Ss 8192		# max stack size (soft limit)
ulimit -Hs unlimited	# max stack size (hard limit)
ulimit -n 1024		# max number of open file descriptors
ulimit -v unlimited	# max size of virtual memory (address space) in KB
