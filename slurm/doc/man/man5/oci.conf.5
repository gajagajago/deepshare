.TH "oci.conf" "5" "Slurm Configuration File" "July 2021" "Slurm Configuration File"

.SH "NAME"
oci.conf \- Slurm configuration file for containers.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Slurm supports calling OCI compliant runtimes. \fBoci.conf\fP is an ASCII
file which defines parameters used by OCI runtime interface.

.LP
Parameter names are case insensitive.
Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of Slurm daemons.

.LP
The following oci.conf parameters are defined to control the behavior
of the \fB\-\-container\fR argument of \fBsalloc\fR, \fBsrun\fR, and \fBsbatch\fR

.TP
\fBContainerPath\fR
Override path pattern for placement of the generated OCI Container bundle
directory. See the section \fBOCI Pattern\fR for details on pattern
replacement.
.sp
Default is unique directory generated in \fBSlurmdSpoolDir\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBCreateEnvFile=(true|false)\fR
Create environment file for container. File will have one environment variable
per line.
.sp
Default is false.
.IP

.TP
\fBRunTimeCreate\fR
Pattern for OCI runtime create operation.  See the section \fBOCI Pattern\fR
for details on pattern replacement.
.sp
Default: (disabled)
.IP

.TP
\fBRunTimeDelete\fR
Pattern for OCI runtime delete operation.  See the section \fBOCI Pattern\fR
for details on pattern replacement.
.sp
Default: (disabled)
.IP

.TP
\fBRunTimeKill\fR
Pattern for OCI runtime kill operation.  See the section \fBOCI Pattern\fR
for details on pattern replacement.
.sp

.IP

.TP
\fBRunTimeQuery\fR
Pattern for OCI runtime query operation (also known as state).  See the section
\fBOCI Pattern\fR for details on pattern replacement.
.sp
Default: (disabled)
.IP

.TP
\fBRunTimeRun\fR
Pattern for OCI runtime run operation. This is not provided in the OCI runtime
specification (<=v1.0) but is provided by multiple OCI runtimes to simplify
execution of containers. If provided, it will be used in the place of create
and start operations. It avoids the need to poll state of the container
resulting in less monitoring overhead. See the section \fBOCI Pattern\fR for
details on pattern replacement.
.sp
Default: (disabled)
.IP

.TP
\fBRunTimeStart\fR
Pattern for OCI runtime statrt operation.  See the section \fBOCI Pattern\fR
for details on pattern replacement.
.sp
Default: (disabled)
.IP
