.SH "NAME"
mpi.conf \- Slurm configuration file to allow the configuration of MPI plugins.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBmpi.conf\fR is an ASCII file which defines parameters that control the
behavior of MPI plugins. Currently the configuration file can only be used
to configure the PMIx plugin, but it can be extended to support other MPI
plugins as well. The file will always be located in the same directory as
the \fBslurm.conf\fR. This file is optional.

Parameter names are case insensitive. Any text following a "#" in the
configuration file is treated as a comment through the end of that line.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of Slurm daemons,
daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution of the command "scontrol
reconfigure" unless otherwise noted.

Settings from this configuration file can be viewed in the output of
"scontrol show config". This configuration file can be included when using
"configless" mode. Information from mpi.conf is read at startup or upon
reconfigure by slurmctld and slurmd. Instances of slurmstepd for batch steps
will receive information about the plugin requested from slurmd.
